Popular Movies: Stage 1 for Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree!

Dear Reviewer,

Thank you for taking the time to review this project. Even though this is just the first of many, I'd like as much feedback as you can muster. I've been programming as a hobby since I was young and am ready to leap toward a career in development; any constructive criticism will be taken seriously and will be utilized in future projects.

Thanks again!!
Jared
